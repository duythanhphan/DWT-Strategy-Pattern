DWT-Strategy-Pattern
====================

The project aims to make use of a simple Strategy pattern where an bstract class, WaveletTransform, defines two virtual methods, analyze and ynthesize and expects subclasses to implement the algorithms based on factors such as the type of mother wavelet used or the type of architecture that the code is running on.
